  - Tested with multiple people on Live Video feed and the confidence of the model was over 100 when it spotted a person that was not in the stored images.

  - We are unsure about his progress with the backend
  - Anusha will reach out after this meeting to question Farzad about his progress

## Action Items
- Alex:
  - Test model with images from internet to test the confidence
  - Read about OpenCV and confidence going over 100
  - Determine upper and lower limits for confidence
