# Meeting Minutes - 04/02/2023
## Attendees
Alex, Anusha, Farzad Ahmed
## Agenda
- Update on progress so far and determine action items for things that need to be completed soon

## Notes / Comments
- Backend:
  - Farzad needs the AWS API on a new account (other than his own)
  - RDS is running on his account
  - Alex: Can access the dummy data in database from DatabaseTest.py in GitHub
- Frontend
  - Completed the website
  - Did some research into the alert generation system
- Model
  - Issue appeared during testing and I (Alex) am currently attempting to fix it
  - Uploaded additional images for testing the confidence of the model
  - I believe uploading a video (of authorized individual) may overload the database so we should probably stick with images

## Action Items
- Anusha: Contact Sai Krishna about Alert Generation so that we are not doing double the work for this
- Farzad: Work on fetching images of authorized individuals from the database
- Farzad: Give access to the database to Anusha
- Alex: Fix issue with model and work on fetching images from database
- Sai Krishna: Contact with Anusha to solve the Alert Generation
